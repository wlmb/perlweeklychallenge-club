Task 1: Arithmetic Triplets
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given an array (3 or more members) of integers in increasing order and a positive integer.

Write a script to find out the number of unique Arithmetic Triplets satisfying the following rules:

a) i < j < k
b) nums[j] - nums[i] == diff
c) nums[k] - nums[j] == diff
Example 1
Input: @nums = (0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10)
       $diff = 3
Output: 2

Index (1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both  7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
Index (2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.
Example 2
Input: @nums = (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
       $diff = 2
Output: 2

(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.

Task 2: Prime Order
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given an array of unique positive integers greater than 2.

Write a script to sort them in ascending order of the count of their prime factors, tie-breaking by ascending value.

Example 1
Input: @int = (11, 8, 27, 4)
Output: (11, 4, 8, 27)

Prime factors of 11 => 11
Prime factors of  4 => 2, 2
Prime factors of  8 => 2, 2, 2
Prime factors of 27 => 3, 3, 3
