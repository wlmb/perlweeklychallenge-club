## Raku

* [Task 1](raku/ch-1.raku)

Sample output
```
$ raku/ch-1.raku
Example 1:
Input: @nums = (0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10)
       $diff = 3
Output: 2

(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 = 3 and 4 - 1 = 3
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 = 3 and 7 - 4 = 3


Example 2:
Input: @nums = (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
       $diff = 2
Output: 2

(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 = 2 and 6 - 4 = 2
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 = 2 and 7 - 5 = 2
```

* [Task 2](raku/ch-2.raku)

Sample output
```
$ raku/ch-2.raku
Example 1:
Input: @int = (11, 8, 27, 4)
Output: (11, 4, 8, 27)

Prime factors of 11 => 11
Prime factors of  4 => 2, 2
Prime factors of  8 => 2, 2, 2
Prime factors of 27 => 3, 3, 3

Example 2:
Input: @int = (2, 4, 8, 12, 11)
Output: (2, 11, 4, 8, 12)

Prime factors of  2 => 2
Prime factors of 11 => 11
Prime factors of  4 => 2, 2
Prime factors of  8 => 2, 2, 2
Prime factors of 12 => 2, 2, 3
```

(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 = 3 and 7 - 4 = 3


Example 2:
Input: @nums = (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
       $diff = 2
Output: 2

(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 = 2 and 6 - 4 = 2
